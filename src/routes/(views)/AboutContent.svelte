			Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Bangladesh. Under the Mycobacterial Disease
			Control (MBDC) unit of the Directorate General of Health Services, the National Tuberculosis
			Control Program (NTP) is working to eliminate TB from Bangladesh. The goal of the program is
			to reduce mortality, morbidity and transmission of TB until it is no longer a public health
			problem. Trained and skilled service providers are needed to achieve NTP’s goal. NTP is
			training service providers to strengthen their capacity to provide quality TB care treatment
			and services. To coordinate training and meet the needs of Bangladesh’s diverse workforce, NTP
			formed an education and training unit (ETU) to institutionalize comprehensive learning;
			provide practical tools, cultivate skills, enhance effective care approaches and improve
			patient centered care to yield a confident and skilled TB care professionals needed to
			successfully combat tuberculosis in Bangladesh. NTP-ETU together with its many and diverse
			partners is responsible for providing training of all categories of health workers who are
			involved with TB program at all service delivery levels. In this regard, ETU identified the
			need for a training management information system (TrMIS). TMIS will support ETU to have real
			time monitoring and available data for planning, reporting & resource allocation. In addition,
			the TrMIS will also work as a resource hub for different training materials, curriculum,
			guideline and job aid.
