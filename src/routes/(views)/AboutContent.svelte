					NTP-ETU together with its many and diverse partners is responsible for providing training
					of all categories of health workers who are involved with TB program at all service
					delivery levels. In this regard, ETU identified the need for a training management
					information system (TrMIS). TMIS will support ETU to have real time monitoring and
					available data for planning, reporting & resource allocation. In addition, the TrMIS will
					also work as a resource hub for different training materials, curriculum, guideline and
